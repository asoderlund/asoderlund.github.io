Hi! I'm Alyssa Soderlund. Welcome to my portfolio website!

I received my Bachelors in Mathematics and minor in computer science from Christopher Newport University in December 2018. I then received my Masters in Data Analytics Engineering from George Mason University in May of 2023. My passion for data science began when I found that I could apply both mathematics and programming to data science problems.

I have always been the kind of person who loves to solve puzzles, and I see every dataset as a puzzle just waiting to be solved. It is fascinating to see what secrets can be unearthed from the analytics process.
